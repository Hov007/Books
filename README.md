CS50 Final Project

The project is a webpage where users can see already existing library with some online books and they also can order books that they would like to read,
I create this webpage to expand my knowledge of python, flask, html and css, and working with databases.

Technologies used:

• Python
• Flask
• HTML
• CSS
• sqlite3

Routing

Each route checks if the user is authenticated. It means if correct username and password were supplied.

Sessions

The webpage uses sessions to confirm that user is registered. Once the user logins, his credentials are checked with database.

Database

Database stores all users and their orderd books.
